#Summary
#####Some of the advantages of refactoring this code were appearance and readability. 
#####Refactoring also did help the data run faster and more consistant.  
#####It was a way of "cleaning up" the exisiting code.

#####A potential disadvantage could be the amount of time it took to re write and test the new code.
